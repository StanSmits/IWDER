                                It is unknown when and where exactly Aiden was born but it can be theorized that he was
                                born either in the year 2013 or 2016 before or during the Harran Virus pandemic that
                                eventually spread across the world. At one point his father saved his life and told him
                                never to forget who he was. Aiden Caldwell is an infected survivor in an infected world.
                                He has agility reminiscent to an Olympic athlete, and brutal combat skills that make him
                                a powerful ally and a valuable commodity in this dangerous world. He can achieve things
                                no one else can, enter places no one else dares. With his unique abilities, Aiden has
                                the power to be an agent of change within this decaying metropolis.

                                Aiden is a member of an outcast group known as the Pilgrims. They constantly wander the
                                world and are compared to ronin and Old West desperadoes. Traveling over 2,000
                                kilometers
                                (1,242 miles) from Crossdale River, Aiden goes to the City in search of his thought to
                                be
                                sister, Mia, who is the key to the past he cannot remember and who Aiden truly is.

                            Aiden Caldwell first meets Hakon as he enters the City, where Hakon saves him from being
                            hanged by the people of the Bazaar. Hakon then gives Aiden an inhibitor and helps him obtain
                            a biomarker.
                            </p>

                                Hakon agrees to help Aiden find passage through to the central loop, which for the first
                                part of the game is locked off and being protected by the Peacekeepers.
                            </p>

                            <p> Later, he confronts Aiden in the church and demands him to give the key to him, but
                                Aiden
                                refuses. Depending on the player’s choices, Hakon will either die at the hands of Aiden
                                himself in self-defense, Lawan, who showed up for revenge, or be spared and saved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hakon’s survival will also determine Lawan’s fate towards the end, where if Aiden
                                decides to
                                let Lawan destroy the missiles before they launch, Hakon will save her from certain
                                death if
                                he is alive. Otherwise, Lawan will end up sacrificing herself to save Villedor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If Hakon is alive, he can end up traveling with Aiden outside of Villedor when the

                                leaves the city, like Hakon desired.
